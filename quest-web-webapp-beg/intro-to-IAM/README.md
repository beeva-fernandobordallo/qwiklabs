# What is AWS IAM?

IAM (Identity and Access Manager) enables control over the security policies applied to your AWS services. With it you can manage: users, user groups, roles and policies. Each of these can allow or deny access/capabilites with respect to a specified AWS resource.

## Exploring users and groups

Within the AWS Console: click Services > IAM or Identity & Access Management
 -> In the IAM console: click Users
 -> In the IAM console: click Groups

#### Note

With regards to users and groups, the console is pretty self explanatory.
The problems might arise when trying to configure correctly policies (permissions) to access services in a limited way, given the vast ammount of options available.
